# Broken Clock Simulator (Python edition)
"Even a broken clock is right twice a day..."

86400 - 2 = ?.

The Broken Clock Simulator is a simple Python application that calculates and displays the deductive fact that based on the number of times a day that a broken clock is right, then it must be wrong a proportionate amount of times to this figure.

It is assumed that each day has 86400 seconds.

The program consists of a `Clock` class that represents a broken clock and a `BrokenClockSim` class containing the main method. 
Running the `BrokenClockSim` class will begin the program and print into the user's console the output of 

`A broken clock is wrong 86398 times a day.`
